# Swiss Tchoukball website

The current Swiss Tchoukball website was built in 2004 by Romain Schmocker using PHP. Since then some additions and improvements have been made, but the code is still based on what was written in 2004. PHP has evolved, so have coding practices. Therefore a lot of improvements can be brought and we hope that using git and GitHub will help going in that direction.
